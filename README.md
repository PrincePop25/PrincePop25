## Hi there 👋

I'm Prince, studying computer programmer and data analysis in Fanshawe College.

Huge fan of Linux, I main drive linux here and there but always tend to come back to windows because of compatibility issue 😅.

I also have a home server where I store images, a personal streaming server, doing redundancy, and exploring with more curiosity that comes.
