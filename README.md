## Hi there 👋

I'm Prince, studying computer programming and data analysis at Fanshawe College.

A huge fan of Linux, I mainly use Linux here and there, but I always tend to come back to Windows because of compatibility issues 😅.

I also have a home server where I store images, a personal streaming server, doing redundancy, and exploring with more curiosity that comes.

## 📄Programming Languages
I am currently learning a lot of languages, but the main languages right now that I am learning are

- C++
- C#
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL

## 🤯Bit More About Me
- ⌛I love Sandbox Game (Yes, Minecraft is my number ONE fav).
- 🎤Love singing, I pretty much sang my whole life (Not that good, so don't expect much).
- 💛Learning Psychology is my favorite thing to do.
